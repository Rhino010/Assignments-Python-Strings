# Task 3: Review Summary

# Implement a script that takes the first 30 characters of a 
# review and appends "â€¦" to create a summary. Ensure that the 
# summary does not cut off in the middle of a word.

# Example: "This product is really good. I'm...",

    "Poor quality product. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",
    "The product was average. Nothing extraordinary about it."
